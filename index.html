          <h3>Withour Limits</h3>
          <p>
            You can choose to overcome some of the limits while embracing
            others. Having time limits, dealing with dependencies and a broken
            software design, having to learn new skills every day to keep up
            with the advances in technology, finding smart ways to fight
            enterprise politics and hardware limitations with limited money is
            what makes our job interesting and rewarding. As engineers, we are
            not the kind of people who like things to be easy, trying to break
            the limits is what drives us to do our best every day.

          <p>
            If you want to grow as a developer, I can't over-emphasize the
            benefits of joining a developer community. There are many
            advantages, from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship,
            sharing support, sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions,
            and much more.
